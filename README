Re mastering of bowling program created by Dr. Joseph Ward

Use BowlSimulator with any number of player files after it to print projected scoresheets
	BowlSimulator eric.txt joe.txt

To redirect the output to a file, use a redirection symbol
	BowlSimulator eric.txt > output.txt

The format of a player file is self explanatory, use the eric.txt as an example.
The scores are projected based off of your bowling average, as well as your "dev"
Dev stands for deviation, the higher your deviation value, the higher your individual frames and games will fluctuate in scores.
0 will allow for nearly no deviation
1 will allow for a small amount
2 is generally good for a human
3 is out right
The user should adjust this value as they see fit
